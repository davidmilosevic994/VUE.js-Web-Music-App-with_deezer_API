# vue-project-web-music-application

Grovvy is a music web app that allows users to explore a wide range of music genres, discover top trending hits, explore albums, and find information about their favorite artists. 

The music web app is structured into various components and pages, all designed to fit seamlessly within a standard desktop display. Key elements, including the page header, navigation sidebar, music player, and a carousel section featuring the latest trending hits, remain constant, ensuring easy access for users. The central part of the page serves as the main section of the app, allowing users to explore genres, discover top artists, and access the top 10 tracks. Leveraging Vue Router, the app enables users to dive into detailed artist profiles, explore albums, and enjoy a wide range of playlists.

Technologies used in creating this project include the Vue.js framework for app development, Vuex for state management and enabling data sharing between components and specifically managing the music player's state and data fetched from the Deezer API. The app seamlessly synchronizes the music player with all other parts of the application. We also utilized the Deezer API for fetching music data and FontAwesome for UI icons.
